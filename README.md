# grunt-spawn-pipe

> Execute your long-running app and pipe its output somewhere else.

# Intro

You have a long running app and you want its output to be processed by another utility.
For example, your Node.js app uses Bunyan for logging, you want the output to be pretty-printed. I.e. to pipe the output of your app to Bunyan.

Existing Grunt plugins use two approaches:

1. Using `child_process.exec()` allows to easily pipe commands but will terminate your app once its buffer gets full. Not a solution for long running apps.
2. Using `child_process.spawn()` fixes the buffer issue but does not allow easy piping.

This plugin is here to allow you to spawn processes and pipe them together.

# Getting Started

This plugin requires Grunt `~1.0.1` and was tested on OS X operating system.

Install the plugin:

```
npm install grunt-spawn-pipe --save-dev
```

Once the plugin is installed, enable it inside your Gruntfile:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-spawn-pipe');
```

# spawnPipe task

Run this task with the `grunt spawnPipe` command.

### Options

The options you set are passed over to every call to Node's `spawn()` function.
Read [Node doc](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options) for more details on which options you can set.

### Usage example

```js
module.exports = function(grunt) {
    grunt.initConfig({
        spawnPipe: {
            ls: {
                options: {
                    cwd: '/'
                },
                commands: [
                    {cmd: 'ls',   args: ['-la']},
                    {cmd: 'grep', args: ['etc']}
                ]
            },
            startDev: {
                commands: [
                    {cmd: 'node',   args: ['src/index.js']},
                    {cmd: 'bunyan', args: ['-o', 'short', '--color']}
                ]
            }
        }
    });

    grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-spawn-pipe');
}
```

`options` and `args` properties are optional. The rest is mandatory.

# Technical details

### Output piping

* The plugin pipes `stdout` of the first command to `stdin` of the second command and so on.
* All `stderr`s are piped to `stderr` of the process executing the spawn commands.
* `stdout` of the last command is piped to `stdout` of the process executing the spawn commands.

### Error handling

If an error occurs in any of the command, for example because of a typo in command name, the first command is killed to ensure the whole piped chain gets terminated.

### Environment

`process.cwd` and `process.env` are used as defaults for all `spawn()` calls. You can override these values in task `options`.
